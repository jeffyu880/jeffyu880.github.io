                    I created a functional Minesweeper game with GUI using C++ and the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML). 
                    This game has file I/O to read custom minesweeper boards created using a txt file, as well as creating custom gameboards and number of mines. 
                    The game also includes a "cheat" mode to view all the mines currently on the board.

                    I created a Python program that uses OpenCv and Canny Edges to detect white and orange ping pong balls and shows the distance of the ball from the webcam.
