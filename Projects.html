                I created a functional Minesweeper game with GUI using C++ and the SFML library. 
                This game has file I/O to read custom mineweeper boards created using a txt file, as well as creating custom gameboards and number of mines. 
                The game also includes a "cheat" mode to view all the mines currently on the board.
