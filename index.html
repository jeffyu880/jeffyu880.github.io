                                Hi, welcome to my website. My name is Jeffrey Yu and I am a student passionate about software and hardware engineering. I am pursing a studying Computer Engineering at the University of Florida.
                                On this website you can see some of the projects I have worked on and some fun tidbits about me.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Outside of learning new concepts from school and on my own, I enjoy fishing, long distance running, and playing team sports. My favorites include ultimate frisbee and soccer. I also love to play the bass and electric guitar, and am always down for a game of Smash Ultimate.
                            </p>
